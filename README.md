![Home Screenshot](public/images/mockups/src.png?raw=true "screenshot")


#### Question:  What is this?
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It is a yearbook project to show off our cohort of the GWG program.</p>

#### Question: Can I contribute?
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Of course you can!  No matter what your experience/knowledge level is we encourage everyone to contribute.</p>

#### Question: Where do I begin?
Grab a task from the Trello site here: <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/BhcQyBcF/2252be83e5f70f6384200fda77035865/udacity-yearbook-site">Trello Udacity YearBook Project.</a> This way we can avoid repetative work. Once you have a task, fork this repo and make changes.  Do whatever it is you want...build upon the boiler plate code, or throw in some JS and link them up to the index...the point in this is about learning, growing, and getting experience as a team :)  Feel free to make edits/contributions to anything! Just don't delete or change someone elses work unless it is for fixes. We don't want someone to create a menu for example and then have it deleted.</p>

- An Editing Software (Vscode, Sublime, Atom)
- Have git installed on your pc using Homebrew `brew install git` for Mac users and `apt-get install git` for Debian/Ubuntu users

Everyone should update their local copies from the main (this) repo. This will resolve a lot of issues.

People can use this as a guide.

We created a Trello page to help plan the project a bit. Here is the invite link <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/BhcQyBcF/2252be83e5f70f6384200fda77035865/udacity-yearbook-site">Trello Udacity YearBook Project</a>

You can see our landing page mockup there, give input on the project, and assign yourself tasks.

We are staring to get into the nitty gritty for the site and we need to make some decisions on how to build it.

1) The framework is going to be Bootstrap v4. I know not everyone has experience with this, but for those that do it will probably make creating the pages much easier. So we are going with that and hoping our more experienced people can help guide us.

2) Unless I hear any objections we are going to go with a color scheme of mainly white and blue. The color scheme used on the Udacity website. We are hoping to achive a smiliar style to that website for continuity.

3) I'm hoping a mockup comes soon. Will keep you posted.

The Resources Page now has a basic html structure. It is ready for contributions from the community. Feel free to add links to your favorite resources and a small description if you would like to.

Subheadings need to be `<h2>` and have the class "subheading". Every subheading needs to have an `<ol>` with `<li>` items so we can keep it looking organized and numbered.

Make sure your links look like this `<a href = "https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>` so that they open on a new page.

Of course this is all subject to change based on what the community wants to do with the pages. Just getting us started for now.
